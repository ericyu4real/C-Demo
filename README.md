# AmazonShopDisplay Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates basic functionalities of an online shopping platform, akin to Amazon, using C++. The `AmazonShopDisplay` class manages a product catalog, including stock levels, and facilitates purchasing items. It showcases object-oriented programming in C++, use of standard library containers, and basic control structures.

## Features
